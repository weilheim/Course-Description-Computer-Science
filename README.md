Mathematics (2012-2013 Semester1) 

This course focuses on advanced calculus tools and the derivation procedure of such tools.
It covers real number theory, concept of limits (the limit of a sequence and a function), 
definitions and properties of continuous functions, differential calculus (differentiable 
functions, rules of differentiation, etc.) and integration.


### 3. Course(s) in Linear Algebra

Algebra and Geometry 1 (2012-2013 Semester 2)
Algebra and Geometry 2 (2013-2014 Semester 1)
These courses are combination of linear algebra and analytic geometry. The linear algebra
part covers the concept of determinant, matrix, linear transform, linear space, eigenvalues,
quadratic form and Euclidean space. And the geometry parts contains important concepts 
such as Cartesian coordinate system and quadric surface (ellipsoid, sphere and paraboloid).


### 4. Course(s) in discrete structure (including local credits)

Discrete Mathematics(A) (2014-2015 Semester 1) 3 credits
Discrete Mathematics is an important branch of modern mathematics and a core fundamental 
course in computer and information science. This course consists of three part: set theory,
basic algebra system and graph theory. And the concepts such as set, function, group, 
domain, lattice, boolean algebra and graph are introduced in the course.
